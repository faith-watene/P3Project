#P3Project

***Business Understanding***
For this project, we will be building a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel,
a telecommunications company. This is a binary classification problem.
Expectedly, the audience here would be the telecom business itself, interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers
who don't stick around very long. Therefore, we will be looking at any predictable patterns that can help us come to a conclusion.
